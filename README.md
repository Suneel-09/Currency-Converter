# Currency-Converter
This project is used to find the value of currency of a country in another country
The project idea has been arised in my brain because I personally use many currency converters on the internet from my childhood inorder to get familiar with currency values of the counties that decides the cost of living of the country
But the problem with many of the currency converters are they are not user friendly . Most of them has complex interface with charts and graphs that makes a normal user who doesn't able to understand charts and graphs to skip that application or even gets iritated and quits the thought of finding currency value of the particular country leading to kill his/her hunger of knowledge 
so I came up with this simple application which is completely user friendly 
It initially displays the currency value of a single penny of the selected 'from' country and 'to' country
The user can select any of the country mentioned in the drop drive menu
The interface is very user friendly 
It also contains a Swap button inorder to swap the 'from' and 'to' countries

This Application is developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript API
