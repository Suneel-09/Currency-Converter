# Currency-Converter
This project is developed to compare the exchange rates of two currencies. 
The project idea has been arised in my brain because I personally use many currency converters on the internet from my childhood inorder to get familiar with currency values of the counties that decides the cost of living of the country . 
But the problem with many of the currency converters are they are not user friendly . Most of them has complex interface with charts and graphs that makes a normal user who doesn't able to understand charts and graphs to skip that application or even gets irritated and quits the thought of finding currency value of the particular country leading to kill his/her hunger of knowledge . 
so I came up with this simple application which is completely user friendly . 
It initially displays the currency value of a single penny of the selected 'from' country and 'to' country . 
The user can select any of the country mentioned in the drop down menu . 
The interface is very user friendly . 
It also contains a Swap button inorder to swap the 'from' and 'to' countries .

This Application is developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript API .
